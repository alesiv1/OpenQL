Simple OpenGL project.

This solution was created to demonstrate my resalt of study OpenGL.
The solution contains 3 simple projects:

1.) Simple triangle project (Folder OpenGLProject).

2.) Simple 3d triangle and cube, with two difficult ways to spin this figure: manual or use FPS indicator (Folder OpenGLProject1).

3.) The project demonstrates a surface with the image that is can include color and bumps (Folder OpenGLProject2).

As a result, I created a different type of projects, with show how can use OpenGL with c# use SharpGl liberty. 
Base SharpGl liberties contained in the folder (OpenGLProject > Dependencies).

The idea for the task I take from the source https://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/code/samples/glut_examples/examples/examples.html
